## Usage

### Starting a Chat

1. Click on the DeepSeek icon in the sidebar to open the chat panel
2. Type your question or prompt in the input box at the bottom
3. Press Enter to send your message

### Working with Files

1. Use the file selector dropdown above the chat input to choose a file from your workspace
2. Click the "Refresh Files" button to update the file list if you've added new files
3. With a file selected, any question you ask will include the file's content in the context
4. DeepSeek will provide responses based on both your question and the selected file's content

### Code Blocks

- Code blocks in responses include copy buttons (üìã) for easy copying
- Click the copy button to copy the code to your clipboard
- Code is formatted and syntax-highlighted for better readability

### Best Practices

- Be specific in your questions
- When asking about code, select the relevant file first
- Use the file selector when you want DeepSeek to analyze or explain specific files
- Clear the file selection when asking general questions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)
2. Check that you have pulled the DeepSeek model (`ollama pull deepseek-r1:70b`)
3. If you see "Failed to connect to DeepSeek" error, restart Ollama and try again
4. Make sure you have an active workspace open in VS Code
5. For development issues:
   - Check the Debug Console in VS Code for errors
   - Try running `npm run compile` to check for compilation errors
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
